                <li>
                    <h3>Spend more time with my family.</h3>
                    <p>“Spend your money on the things you can buy.
                        Spend your time on the things money can’t buy.”
                        Spending quality time with my family is a top 
                        priority. One’s life isn’t long so I shouldn’t forget
                        to spend more time with my most precious people. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Get that college degree.</h3>
                    <p>Earning a college degree is my primary goal as a
                        current student, pivotal for achieving my broader
                        aspirations. It's key to shaping my future, equipping
                        me with vital skills, and opening doors to diverse 
                        career opportunities, signifying a crucial step

                    <h3>Know myself better.</h3>
                    <p> At 20, I'm on a quest to know myself better,
                        embracingself-discovery and growth. Understanding
                        who I am boosts confidence and shapes my choices.
                        Prioritizing mental health is vital; it involves
                        nurturing positivity, managing stress, and fostering
                        healthier relationships. This journey isn't
                        straightforward, but through self-reflection and
                        genuine connections, I strive for a more balanced,
                        fulfilling life.</p>

            <h2>My Journal</h2>
            <p>As the sun rises, painting the sky with hues of dawn, I find
                myself amidst a maze of uncertainties that cloud my vision 
                of the future. The next five years seem distant and shrouded
                in ambiguity, leaving me anxious about where my path will 
                lead. I grapple with the uncertainty of not knowing what I 
                truly want, wrestling with a quest for clarity amid the fog 
                of indecision.</p>

            <p>In the midst of this ambiguity, my aspirations stand as
                guiding stars, shimmering faintly amidst the uncertainty. My
                fervent hope is to find happiness and stability within myself.
                Mental well-being becomes an anchor in the stormy sea of
                uncertainty. I yearn for a future where I am content, where
                inner peace resonates within me.</p>

            <p>Financial stability also weighs heavily on my mind. I aspire
                to secure a good job, not just for personal gain but to 
                alleviate the burdens my parents bear. Their sacrifices 
                propel me forward, igniting a fire within to strive for a 
                career that supports them and allows me to contribute 
                meaningfully.</p>

            <p>Moreover, I harbor aspirations of delving into the realm of
                psychology, a field that beckons me with its promise of
                understanding the human mind. Pursuing this course becomes a
                beacon of academic ambition, a path I earnestly desire to
                tread upon.</p>

            <p>Yet, beyond the tangible achievements and external validations,
                I hold a quieter, more profound wish—to love and be proud of 
                the person I become in the next five years. Self-acceptance 
                and growth stand as the cornerstones upon which I wish to 
                build my future.</p>

            <p>As I pen down these aspirations, I acknowledge the
                uncertainties that cloud my path. However, I hold onto these
                dreams, nurturing them with hope and determination. With each
                passing day, I aim to take steps, no matter how small, toward
                the future I envision—a future filled with happiness, 
                stability, accomplishments, and self-love.</p>

            <h2>Note for Myself in the Next 5 Years</h2>
            <p>Always Remeber: Be sure you don't spend so much time making 
                money that you forget that someday all you wish you could buy
                is more time. Also, don't overwork yourself! Health is 
                wealth.</p>
